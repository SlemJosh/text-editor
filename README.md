## Description

If you are like me, you are in constant need of some form of taking notes.  But sometimes when you are restricted to using only digital means the options for how to take those notes are not so great.  This app gives you another text editor that you will be able to install and use even when offline. No need to fear if you are changing platforms, as this web based text editor will be accessible and allow you the ability to keep that text at your side. This app also served as a way to experience and play around with PWA structures.
